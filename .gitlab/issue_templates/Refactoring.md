# Refactoring Request

**Summary:**
Refactor the user authentication module to improve readability, maintainability, and test coverage.

**Current Implementation:**
- The `auth.py` file is over 600 lines long and mixes authentication logic with session handling.
- Hard-coded validation rules make it difficult to extend or reuse.
- Unit test coverage is only ~45%.

**Refactoring Goals:**
- Split `auth.py` into smaller modules: `validators.py`, `session_manager.py`, and `oauth_handler.py`.
- Remove duplicate code for password validation and centralize it in a utility function.
- Improve test coverage to at least 85%.
- Follow PEP8 and project linting rules enforced by Ruff.

**Proposed Approach:**
1. Create a new `auth/` directory with submodules.
2. Gradually move existing functions into their respective files.
3. Write new unit tests for each module.
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing APIs.

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- Risk: Breaking existing login flow.  
  Mitigation: Add integration tests before starting refactor.
- Risk: Increased merge conflicts.  
  Mitigation: Communicate refactoring plan with the team before changes.

**Additional Context:**
- Related to Issue #92 (Improve Authentication Reliability).
- Requested by the QA team due to difficulty in writing test cases.
