# Feature Request 🎭

**Act 1:** Enter the eco-warriors 🌍.  
They demand a feature: “Give us an **Eco-Friendly Route Mode**!”  

**Act 2:** The app listens, bows, and responds:  
“Yes, I shall calculate routes that sip fuel, not gulp it!”  

**Vision:**
- Toggle for “Eco-Friendly Mode” 🌱.  
- Integration with CO2 APIs.  
- A glowing display: “You saved 2L fuel & 3kg CO2!”  

**Dramatic Conflict:**
Users currently try to force shorter routes manually…  
But alas! Short does not always mean green.  

**Resolution:**
By adding this feature, our app becomes the shining knight of ESG compliance.
