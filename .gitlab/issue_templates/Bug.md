# Bug Report 🎭

**Scene:** The stage is our travel planner.  
**Act 1:** A user enters more than 50 waypoints.  
**Act 2:** The app struggles, gasps for breath, and collapses with a **500 error**.  

🧾 **Dialogue:**
- User: “Oh mighty app, take me through all these 50+ places!”  
- App: *freezes dramatically for 20 seconds*  
- App: “Alas! Too many waypoints… MemoryError strikes me down!”  

🎯 **Expected Plot:**
The hero app gracefully computes the optimal path for all waypoints.  

💥 **Tragic Twist:**
Instead, it crashes, leaving the audience staring at a blank error screen.  

📜 **Environment Setting:**
- Ubuntu 22.04  
- Chrome 115.0  
- Python 3.11  
- PostgreSQL 15  

**Curtain Drops...**
