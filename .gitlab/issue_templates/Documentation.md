# Documentation Update 🎭

**Act 1:**
The README is a lone wanderer — it only speaks of Python local setups.  

**Act 2:**
The crowd cries, “Docker! Docker! Show us the containerized way!”  

**Proposed Rewrite:**
The README now steps forward, dramatically declaring:  
```bash
docker build -t travel-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 travel-app
