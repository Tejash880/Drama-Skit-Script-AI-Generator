# Feature Request

**Summary:**
Add Dark Mode support to the web application.

**Use Case:**
Many users work in low-light environments and prefer a dark interface to reduce eye strain. Currently, the platform only supports a light theme, which can be uncomfortable for extended use.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Introduce a theme toggle (Light/Dark) in the user settings menu.
- Store user preference in the database and local storage for consistency across sessions.
- Ensure UI components adapt seamlessly with proper contrast and accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1).

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Relying on browser/system-level dark mode settings (not flexible enough).
- Custom CSS extensions by users (inconvenient and inconsistent).

**Additional Context:**
- Multiple users (feedback IDs: #23, #41, #72) have requested this feature.
- Competitor platforms already provide theme options.
- A design mockup is available in Figma: [Dark Mode Design](https://www.figma.com/file/xyz123).
