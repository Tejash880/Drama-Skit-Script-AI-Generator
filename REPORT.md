## 1. Project Overview
DramaScript is an open-source platform designed to help playwrights, directors, and actors collaboratively create and manage theatrical scripts. The platform supports writing Acts and Scenes, adding stage directions, character dialogues, and rehearsal notes.  

**Key Features:**
- ‚úçÔ∏è Write and edit scripts in a structured format (Acts & Scenes)  
- üé¨ Include stage directions, lighting, and music cues  
- üë• Real-time collaboration between writers, directors, and actors  
- üìö Version control for tracking script changes  
- üíæ Save and download scripts for offline rehearsal

## 2. Motivation
Theatrical productions often involve multiple contributors, and managing script updates can be chaotic. DramaScript centralizes script development and rehearsal instructions, making it easy to maintain consistency and improve collaboration.
